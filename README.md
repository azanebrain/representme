# Represent Me

This project was created during the Global Startup Battle 2015 as part of San Diego's Social Impact event.

The official site can be found at: [RepresentMeNow.co](http://representmenow.co)

It is a WordPress powered Ionic hybrid app which uses actual legislation data to compare your stance on topics against our current representatives to help citizens decide who to vote for.

This branch contains the WordPress site, the `ionic` branch contains the hybrid mobile app.
